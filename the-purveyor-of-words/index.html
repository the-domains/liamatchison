As far as he knew, he was the only one who made his living this way. He found this was the best way to survive in what was left of this suburb ever since the day the world fell apart. At first he had kept a calendar by making marks on the wall for each new day, but soon he missed a day, then two, then found himself hopelessly behind. He berated himself for his lack of discipline. A purveyor of words ought to be able to preserve the memory of time. This last thought intermittently assailed him, and he wallowed in it until he waved an arm backhandedly in front of his face and the guilt vanished. "After all," he reasoned, "I may be the first purveyor of words in this ugly, new world. It is enough that I remember some words and their meaning." </p><p>The words. What joy he brought to his dirty-faced neighbors as he pronounced the melodious sounds of a beautiful language that filled books he no longer possessed. No one else possessed them either, and now he alone was responsible to keep the memory of words alive and this made him a valuable member of the community. He was the only person he knew who made his living with his mind. The rest lived as brutes. First they lost their ability to reason, then they lost their memory of the past, then the end came. "Pottage," thought Mr. Raye. "Middle English, from the French.   </p><p>He traded his inheritance for a mess of pottage. </p><p>It shouldn't be hard to explain Esau to a tribe of Esaus, but how do I explain lentils? It will only enrage them as they focus on their empty stomachs." Mr. Raye prayed he could remember this word. His life might depend on it.</p><p>This morning, and every morning, Mr. Raye climbed out of the hut of wood and stone that had once been his parent's neat tract house and strolled along the Berm looking for items that might aid his survival. The Berm was a long high mound of dirt that covered what were once known as streets. Overgrown with weeds, it was high enough to prevent neighbors from seeing one another and there were smaller, steeper mounds between adjoining homes. These homes, similar to Mr. Raye's, reposed in damp, verdant, bowls that would be perfectly formed had it not been for narrow passages through the piles along the Berm. Mr. Raye navigated these passages with such regularity that his ubiquitous presence hardly raised an eyebrow from his vigilant fellow-sufferers.</p><p>Mr. Raye was like a thin thread that connected the lives of the people who lived in Wallington--for that had been the name of this suburb--and this wiry, cerebral man kept that name alive in their thoughts as well.</p><p>It was a warm day in late summer or early fall, and Mr. Raye was looking for wood, or for something he could trade for wood. He knew that wood would be easier to stockpile now before his neighbors discovered a leaf changing color or felt a small dip in the temperature. He already had a formidable stack, which he had gathered during the rainy spring when Wallingtonites hacked up hedgerows in search of fronds to cover their roofs against the hard showers. Mr. Ra​ye carried away branches, trunks, and roots which he placed on his roof to dry. His neighbors did not suspect that he retained from the old world a drum of tar, the contents of which he used for repairs. He knew where to look first.
