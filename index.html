I was sipping my first cup of coffee from my Yeti, and had my plaid Thermos, circa 1960, in my rucksack filled with more Peet’s Italian Roast brew. It was Tuesday so I did not teach but had office hours, after which I was to lunch with Professor Fieler. He had asked to meet because he had fresh thoughts on the murder investigation and said mine was the only coffee he could tolerate. I hoped there would be something more substantial than mere coffee and carbs, but Fieler loved doughnuts almost as much as my coffee. At least the preferred shop across from the campus had Maple Bacon doughnuts with thick slabs of smoked rashers atop taupe frosting made from powdered sugar and Mrs. Butterworth’s. There was more than one way to squeeze in some protein though Fieler made it difficult. He would ridicule my piggy bun as a travesty. He always ate plain and dunked them till a swirl of crumbs appeared as a crust atop the long-cold beverage.</p></div></div></div></section><section id="5" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fl-l fade-in  color-bg section-height-fullscreen text-align-center  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="78"><div class="Component p-2 ls-m-l-20p ls-m-r-0 w-60p max-w-0 " data-reactid="79"><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f3a2087b7c79231d6fc5a85da6ca4f21026b0e6b.jpg" alt="Germany&apos;s unoffcial intellectual capital" title="Heidelberg"><p>Mr. Raye was not merely a scrounger, he was a purveyor of words. As far as he knew, he was the only one who made his living this way. He found this was the best way to survive in what was left of this suburb ever since the day the world fell apart. At first he had kept a calendar by making marks on the wall for each new day, but soon he missed a day, then two, then found himself hopelessly behind. He berated himself for his lack of discipline. A purveyor of words ought to be able to preserve the memory of time. This last thought intermittently assailed him, and he wallowed in it until he waved an arm backhandedly in front of his face and the guilt vanished. "After all," he reasoned, "I may be the first purveyor of words in this ugly, new world. It is enough that I remember some words and their meaning." </p><p>The words. What joy he brought to his dirty-faced neighbors as he pronounced the melodious sounds of a beautiful language that filled books he no longer possessed. No one else possessed them either, and now he alone was responsible to keep the memory of words alive and this made him a valuable member of the community. He was the only person he knew who made his living with his mind. The rest lived as brutes. First they lost their ability to reason, then they lost their memory of the past, then the end came. "Pottage," thought Mr. Raye.

I have just been thinking how much more powerful his aphorism would have been if the dullest pencil was also the best and the beautiful. In his youth America was still in search of a good five-cent cigar, but could wars have been averted with a superior penny pencil?There are the whole foods and tiny house movements. Perhaps there should be a Dull Pencil movement!

I write daily as a devotional exercise and there is nothing like drinking pour-over-brewed coffee from a steaming cup in the soft light of the early morning with a robust fountain pen seemingly guiding my hand as it smoothly sails over Clairefontaine paper. The Brilliant-Braun Pelikan ink transforms my thoughts into flowing rivers that I would love to describe as beautiful in themselves were it not that my scrawl hardly matches the functionality of my tools. Sadly, Plato’s ideals include perfect calligraphy. I have three cherished fountain pens (so far) that I will pass down to my children when I die. But if fountain pens were wine and I were a connoisseur of both wine and beer, then my 1.3 mm Pentel Fiesta mechanical pencil would be my favorite brew.</p></div></div></div></section></div><section id="11" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-local " data-reactid="212"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="213"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="214"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="215"><span data-reactid="216"><!-- react-empty: 217 --><h2 data-reactid="218"><a data-reactid="219">flashfictory</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="220"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="221"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="222"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="223"></div></section></div></div>
