As far as he knew, he was the only one who made his living this way. He found this was the best way to survive in what was left of this suburb ever since the day the world fell apart. At first he had kept a calendar by making marks on the wall for each new day, but soon he missed a day, then two, then found himself hopelessly behind. He berated himself for his lack of discipline. A purveyor of words ought to be able to preserve the memory of time. This last thought intermittently assailed him, and he wallowed in it until he waved an arm backhandedly in front of his face and the guilt vanished. "After all," he reasoned, "I may be the first purveyor of words in this ugly, new world. It is enough that I remember some words and their meaning." </p><p>The words. What joy he brought to his dirty-faced neighbors as he pronounced the melodious sounds of a beautiful language that filled books he no longer possessed. No one else possessed them either, and now he alone was responsible to keep the memory of words alive and this made him a valuable member of the community. He was the only person he knew who made his living with his mind. The rest lived as brutes. First they lost their ability to reason, then they lost their memory of the past, then the end came. "Pottage," thought Mr. Raye.

One of my late father’s favorite adages was, “the dullest pencil is keener than the sharpest mind.” he meant that I had better write down my ideas before I forget them. I have just been thinking how much more powerful his aphorism would have been if the dullest pencil was also the best and the beautiful. In his youth America was still in search of a good five-cent cigar, but could wars have been averted with a superior penny pencil?There are the whole foods and tiny house movements. Perhaps there should be a Dull Pencil movement! Before you think I am suffering from lead poisoning from chewing too many Ticonderoga #2 barrels, allow me to elaborate.</p><p>Those closest to me know how I love writing instruments, particularly fountain pens. I write daily as a devotional exercise and there is nothing like drinking pour-over-brewed coffee from a steaming cup in the soft light of the early morning with a robust fountain pen seemingly guiding my hand as it smoothly sails over Clairefontaine paper. The Brilliant-Braun Pelikan ink transforms my thoughts into flowing rivers that I would love to describe as beautiful in themselves were it not that my scrawl hardly matches the functionality of my tools. Sadly, Plato’s ideals include perfect calligraphy. I have three cherished fountain pens (so far) that I will pass down to my children when I die. But if fountain pens were wine and I were a connoisseur of both wine and beer, then my 1.3 mm Pentel Fiesta mechanical pencil would be my favorite brew.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ls-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="117"><!-- react-empty: 118 --></div></section><section id="7" class="Section Section--components-1 color-bg color-title section-bgcover-wo title-size-medium p-0 text-align-center group-order-normal  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="119"><div class="Component ls-fx-r fx-w-w j-c-between a-i-stretch" data-reactid="120"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-0 fx-b-50p w-100p ls-w-50p" data-reactid="121"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="122"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="123"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/faaf0c01c1686441cbf95481f985deed/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fc9d0056675ce030342e19069265fe734326fdca8.jpg&amp;width=720" style="object-position:50% 50%;" data-reactid="124"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/faaf0c01c1686441cbf95481f985deed/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fc9d0056675ce030342e19069265fe734326fdca8.jpg&amp;width=720" style="object-position:50% 50%;" data-reactid="125"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/faaf0c01c1686441cbf95481f985deed/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fc9d0056675ce030342e19069265fe734326fdca8.jpg&amp;width=720" style="object-position:50% 50%;" data-reactid="126"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/6af8e0766d458a61f11d2cc778b5c5dd/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fc9d0056675ce030342e19069265fe734326fdca8.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:50% 50%;" data-reactid="127"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="720" data-height="720" data-ratio="1" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/faaf0c01c1686441cbf95481f985deed/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fc9d0056675ce030342e19069265fe734326fdca8.jpg&amp;width=720" style="object-position:50% 50%;" data-reactid="128"/></picture></div></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-2 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8 color-title fx-b-50p" data-reactid="129"><!-- react-empty: 130 --><div class="" data-reactid="131"><!-- react-text: 132 --> <!-- /react-text --><div class="Paragraph Caption m-t-1 l-h-m " data-reactid="133"><p data-reactid="134">Chemex...a Tangle...and dark roast beans.</p></div><h3 class="m-t-1 m-b-05 font-title undefined" data-reactid="135"><span data-reactid="136">Convivium Coffee</span></h3><div class="Attribution color-title2 undefined" data-reactid="137"><h5 data-reactid="138"><span class="Author color-title2" data-reactid="139"><a href="http://http://liamatchison.com/?p=563" data-reactid="140">Dr. Liam Atchison</a></span></h5></div><div class="Paragraph l-h-m undefined" data-reactid="141">Relating a little story by Claudia Roden.</div></div><!-- react-empty: 142 --><!-- react-empty: 143 --><!-- react-empty: 144 --><div class="Paragraph color-text " data-reactid="145"><p data-reactid="146">Mediterranean cookery expert and coffee aficionada Claudia Roden once related the story of a Viennese man who loved java and conversation.
