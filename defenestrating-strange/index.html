<p>I was hardly awake the next morning as I floated the three blocks to the southeast corner of campus then labored up the hill to Bradley Hall. I was sipping my first cup of coffee from my Yeti, and had my plaid Thermos, circa 1960, in my rucksack filled with more Peet’s Italian Roast brew. It was Tuesday so I did not teach but had office hours, after which I was to lunch with Professor Fieler. He had asked to meet because he had fresh thoughts on the murder investigation and said mine was the only coffee he could tolerate. I hoped there would be something more substantial than mere coffee and carbs, but Fieler loved doughnuts almost as much as my coffee. At least the preferred shop across from the campus had Maple Bacon doughnuts with thick slabs of smoked rashers atop taupe frosting made from powdered sugar and Mrs. Butterworth’s. There was more than one way to squeeze in some protein though Fieler made it difficult. He would ridicule my piggy bun as a travesty. He always ate plain and dunked them till a swirl of crumbs appeared as a crust atop the long-cold beverage. </p><p>Desecrated Joe was on my mind as I drew near to Bradley Hall and noticed a huge cone of black stuff that looked like coffee grounds, but was probably topsoil piled perhaps ten feet high right against the east wall of Bradley. A group of maybe ten undergraduates was standing akimbo nearby silently gaping at the stack. Was Campus Maintenance digging up a sewer line? As I got close, I saw no hole. Is this landscaping? I noticed that the windows in the classroom above the pile of dirt were open, and I could see figures in the classroom darting back and forth. Was there a scuffle? I could then hear raised voices in the heat of some sort of argument, and I thought I recognized the shouts of the loudest combatant. It was Fieler! </p><p>I entered Bradley and hurried up the steps to the second floor. My office was on the third, and I was already late, but I wanted to see what was happening. I noticed my breathlessness as I pushed through the door that opened into the hallway and turned to the right. I don’t have to go far. It was Fieler’s room, and the volume was amplified in the cold industrial corridor. It sounded like a pack of hungry dogs snarling at one another. I looked over the heads of two women students who were standing just outside Room 203. </p><p>Dr. Richard Fieler was conducting a lecture in Early Modern European History. What sounded like a free for all was just Fieler pressing in his most earnest tones for a volunteer to take part in his demonstration. “Every semester you all complain about how boring my lectures are because you are barbarians in the most sincere sense of the term!” he said. I could see the students working out this insult. Barbarians were somehow progressivist heroes in their video game lives. </p><p>“So, ‘here is the opportunity,’ as Casey Stengel used to say!” Fiedler was winding up even more if that was possible but the barbarians had no idea who Stengel was. “You can avoid a nasty, dry lecture by helping me demonstrate this crucial event in the seventeenth-century that ignited a continental war! Perhaps we should be so lucky! We could start a war here and now and you could say you did one thing of significance in your life! Come now! And I have gone to great lengths to correctly simulate the original events!" </p><p>A small, wiry undergraduate male with short brown hair and a tattoo on the side of his neck that looked like a red and black cumulus cloud stood up with a wry grin on his face. “Professor Fieler, I’ll volunteer!” Fieler was pleased. "Why, Mr. Strange, I thought you were asleep. By all means, jump up there!" </p><p>Strange jumped up on the windowsill and Fieler, quick as a cat, leaped up beside him and put him in a half-nelson and looked out the window at the ground. I could sense he was estimating distance. The classroom erupted in laughter, and things began to move in slow motion. Someone shouted. Was that me? “RICHARD, NO!” He was shifting Strange’s weight from Fieler's left to his right side—toward the open window. But he stopped and stared at me. The eyes of every student in the full room turned toward me in silence. The bell rang, the period had ended, and the barbarians departed taking Strange with them. </p><p>“Good heavens, Bill,” Fieler said in his debating voice. “Whatever did you do that for?" </p><p>“Richard, there are safer ways to demonstrate the Defenestration of Prague!” I remonstrated. </p><p>“Perhaps, but look now! What a shame to waste all this damn beautiful manure. I will have to get Crowley to haul it back to the University Gardens.” </p><p>“You asked the building custodian to haul several tons of manure a mile so you could throw a student out the window?” I gasped. </p><p>“He had nothing else to do. Besides, he could get into the horticulture department to get the key to the gate because of his uniform." </p><p>“What? They don’t know it’s missing? He stole all their poop?" </p><p>He wore his hurt look now, staring at the ground. “Not all of it, just what I calculated that was needed." </p><p>“Calculated? You teach in the humanities! What do you know about such calculations? It was foolish!” I regretted the last comment even as it escaped my lips. </p><p>He drew himself up proudly. “It was not foolish! I am AN historian! I researched it, and this pile of poop is the exact size the Bohemian shit pile had to be, and just as the imperial representatives would have survived, so Strange would have come off without a scratch. He would not have smelled much worse, and it might have stimulated his otherwise sluggish little gray cells!" </p><p>I was speechless before this puffed-up little man with wild hair and a ridiculous pocket protector. A small spiral notebook protruded from the pocket with pens and pencils sticking out like porcupine quills. I laughed first. The tension was broken. He laughed and clapped his hands together. </p><p>“I am late for my office hours. Are we going to discuss the case?” I asked. </p><p>“Did you bring your coffee? It is the only coffee worth drinking around here,” he said. “And I’ll treat for donuts—as long as they are the plain kind."</p></div></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="36"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="37"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="38"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="39"><span data-reactid="40"><!-- react-empty: 41 --><h2 data-reactid="42"><a data-reactid="43">flashfictory</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="44"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="45"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="46"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="47"></div></section></div></div>

He always ate plain and dunked them till a swirl of crumbs appeared as a crust atop the long-cold beverage.
