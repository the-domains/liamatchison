  I designed this website as a repository for my experiments in flash writing. I
  am an historian with a Ph.D. in Early Modern European intellectual history
  with an emphasis on Rezeptionsgeschichte and the history of hermeneutics. I am
  married, have two grown children (who are also ma​rried), two granddaughters,
  and a Schnoodle. I work with a guild of scholars who serve universities around
  the world. I am a Kansan.
