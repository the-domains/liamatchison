![The creator of the site.](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6d1e39a6-2172-4a27-b096-b30532bac62e.jpg)

I designed this website as a repository for my experiments in flash writing. I am an historian with a Ph.D. in Early Modern European intellectual history with an emphasis on _Rezeptionsgeschichte_ and the history of hermeneutics. I am married, have two grown children (who are also maâ€‹rried), and a Schnoodle. I work with a guild of scholars who serve universities around the world. I am a Kansan.
