            <title><![CDATA[My Baseball Retrospective]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>My Baseball Retrospective</h1><p>I was born in a small town in Kansas when Ike was President a​nd the Brooklyn Dodgers were the baseball champions of the world. My dad enjoyed the ’55 Series because he loved underdogs, but especially because he hated the New York Yankees. The Yankees always seemed to win and to dominate the other teams in the American League, of which my dad was a fan. Specifically, he followed the fortunes of the Athletics, who often lost their best players to the Yankees. When I was old enough, he would take me and my three older brothers with him to watch twi-night or weekend double-headers at Kansas City’s Municipal Stadium, usually when the A’s were playing the dreaded team from the Bronx. I enjoyed the games so much, and being with my father in the crowd surrounded by smells of stale cigar smoke and beer, I never realized how bad a team the A’s really were. I never noticed that they were at the bottom of the standings year after year.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/c58adcf058a303ae7a92bd6eb6c572c337cd58bb.jpg"></article>]]></description>
