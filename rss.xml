            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Minds Don’t Move: Inspired by G. K. Chesterton</h1><p>Drained from incessant grilling by the army of reporters during the news conference, Mr. Slight was escorted out of the building and across the street by four older men in expensive, dark suits. Feeling a light drizzle on his face, Mr. Slight glanced at the lowering gray skies and heard the quick splash of his loafers on the pavement. His companions led him to a highly polished black door atop a stoop with three well-worn concrete steps.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Traveling East (Along Prairie Highways)</h1><p>Do you remember when we were young and free from concerns of time and place, and when we would encounter eternal moments by chance? We would drive east along prairie highways that rolled and snaked through broad meadows of tall bleached corn stalks, fenced by wooded domes and moated by crumbling gullies.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/204a18ae77a2d79d37ad0586fbb38dcec0e2c885.jpg"></article>]]></description>
