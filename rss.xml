            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Ode to a dull pencil |</h1><p>In yesterday's post I discussed the adage that is the title of this blog. One of my late father's favorite adages was, "the dullest pencil is keener than the sharpest mind." he meant that I had better write down my ideas before I forget them.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/aaafc2a32308d7b3ce02163c29e461ed6f0dcc65.jpg"></article>]]></description>
