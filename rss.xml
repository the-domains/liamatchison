            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Minds Don’t Move: Inspired by G. K. Chesterton</h1><p>Drained from incessant grilling by the army of reporters during the news conference, Mr. Slight was escorted out of the building and across the street by four older men in expensive, dark suits. Feeling a light drizzle on his face, Mr. Slight glanced at the lowering gray skies and heard the quick splash of his loafers on the pavement. His companions led him to a highly polished black door atop a stoop with three well-worn concrete steps. The sole bearded man in the group opened the door for Mr. Slight and invited him to enter the building first with a wave of his hand.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/433870c31a2c20f4f883511788e6a93e6ae4811a.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Traveling East (Along Prairie Highways)</h1><p>Do you remember when we were young and free from concerns of time and place, and when we would encounter eternal moments by chance? We would drive east along prairie highways that rolled and snaked through broad meadows of tall bleached corn stalks, fenced by wooded domes and moated by crumbling gullies.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/204a18ae77a2d79d37ad0586fbb38dcec0e2c885.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[My Baseball Retrospective]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>My Baseball Retrospective</h1><p>I was born in a small town in Kansas when Ike was President a​nd the Brooklyn Dodgers were the baseball champions of the world. My dad enjoyed the ’55 Series because he loved underdogs, but especially because he hated the New York Yankees. The Yankees always seemed to win and to dominate the other teams in the American League, of which my dad was a fan. Specifically, he followed the fortunes of the Athletics, who often lost their best players to the Yankees. When I was old enough, he would take me and my three older brothers with him to watch twi-night or weekend double-headers at Kansas City’s Municipal Stadium, usually when the A’s were playing the dreaded team from the Bronx. I enjoyed the games so much, and being with my father in the crowd surrounded by smells of stale cigar smoke and beer, I never realized how bad a team the A’s really were. I never noticed that they were at the bottom of the standings year after year.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/c58adcf058a303ae7a92bd6eb6c572c337cd58bb.jpg"></article>]]></description>
